# CateCleanSpec

Reorganizes PDF specifications from Imperial College's CATe system in different folders for each course.

In the Bash script or in the Alfred Workflow: 
  * Set ORIGIN to the directory where your specs are saved.
  * Set DESTINATION to the directory where you want your folders saved.
  * Modify the course code and names to add support for additional courses.
